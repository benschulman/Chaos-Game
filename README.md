# Chaos-Game
A simple game dealing with chaos theory.

Directions:
Click anywhere on the screen to choose a starting point then click "Iterate" to begin iterating.
The program will choose any of the three large dots at random and will draw a new, small dot half way between the starting dot and the large dot.
This process will repeat for every new dot. The default number of iterations is 10000. To change the number of iterations, click "Adjust Iterations".
To clear the screen, click "RESET".
To add more large dots, click the location you would like that dot to appear, then click "Add Dot".
